I'm a software engineer working in Automated Test Equipment ([ATE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_test_equipment)) industry based in Geneva.

I'm a generalist with experience in embedded software development, computer vision, ROS, mobile applications, APIs, backend services and websites. I also have a background in electronics.

I mainly use C, C++ and C# and have huge interest over Crystal and Rust.

Beside programming:

- I am attracted to vintage stuff.
- I practice [Kendo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cb13DKpDd_k).
